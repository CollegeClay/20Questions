This assignment was definetly a little challenging, but very doable. 
I really liked this assignment. It allowed me to get a lot more confortable with binary trees and inputing text into a file. I feel like I have learned 
a lot and am a lot more confident that if I see a binary tree problem on the next midterm that I will be able to do it. I disliked that we had a project
the week before spring break, but that is just school so I can't complain to much.

I spent about four hours working on this assignment.
I didn't add any novel features.

PS: Hope you all have an amazing spring break!
